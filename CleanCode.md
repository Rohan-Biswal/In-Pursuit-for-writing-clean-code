## Day-1(There will be code)
- Some people belive that in the era of AI and generative technology code will vanish one day.
- But according to this book all this thought are rubbish.
- This will never happen. Not even humans, with all their intuition and creativity,
have been able to create successful systems from the vague feelings of their customers.

## Day-2(Bad code)
- How a persone is writting code matters because there are two types of code good and bad code.
- Bad code means if a programmer write a code and it will be difficult for others to understand that means the bad code.
- Authore gave a very good example of this is their was a company who had launched a software. Author himself used that software but, after sometime there were some bugs coming inside that.
- The company launched new version of that but not able to solve the problem.
- But why is it so?
- Because the code which was written for that software was a Bad Code.
- Due to that the product failed in the market and the company needs to shutdown.

## Day-3(The Total Cost of Owning a Mess)
- The author is describing the if you are a programmer so definately you came across bad and messy code.
- Also gave a graph of productivity which shows when you are working in a project earlier the pase is very fast and don't think about its cleaness and later when you move ahead your pase changed to snail's speed.
- Reason is that when its need to modify or add new things to it the code become such a great mess people themself don't understand their code.
- Why the good code rot so quickly into bad code?
- He says its because of unprofessional way and not spending sufficent time.
- As a result the excuse given by them is the load and pressure on the is too much.
- Also have lack or resources to achive that.
- But author clearly says that 'This may be a bitter pill to  swallow'.
